# Random Password Generator

We were tasked with taking a vague javaScript code with a few functions, and turn it into a fully functioning Random Password Generator. The style and the HTML were provided for us.

## Once you push the generate button

There is an Event Listener associated with the Generate Password button. When the user presses said button, they are prompted with five seperate prompts that all record their own value. These values will determine the length and the type of characters the user wants in their password.

### After the data is recorded

Once all of the data is recorded the generator will take the results of the prompts and create an array of chosen characters to generate the users' password. After the array has been created, the characters go into a formula that will create a unique password that matches all of the given criteria. You will recieve your unique password:
